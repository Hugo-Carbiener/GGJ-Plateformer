We made this video game during the 2022 [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) held in Evry-Courcouronnes, France. The objective was to create a video game from scratch as a team in the span of 48 hours.

### The **theme** of this Game Jam was 
![duality](duality.png)

This theme brought our reflexion toward a local multiplayer game where the mechanics would make the gameplay either **asymetrical** or **complementary**. This is how the first idea of Geckolot started.

# **Our Game** ![gecko](Gecko2.png) ![gecko](Gecko2.png) ![gecko](Gecko2.png) ![gecko](Gecko2.png)

It consists in a local two-player player game that relies on the duality between attraction and repulsion. The first player controls an extroverted **Axolotl** that has the power to attract the other player. Symetrically, the second player controls an introverted **Gecko** that tend to push others away.

Be it to go back home or to finally reach the outside and go explore the world, our two little protagonists will have to work together to get out of the cave.

We are immensely proud of the game we came up with at the end of the Jam. The end product was really satisfying despite it being **the first Game Jam ever** for most of the team.

We were a team of 7 students from [Telecom Sudparis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), ranging from junior to senior year.
